## Configure Balena

In order for the device to be able to connect, you need to define the following environment variable inside of Balena's web interface:

 * AWS_DEVICE_ID - The device or thing ID from Amazon when you enrolled the device (likely `x_d_wott_local`)
 * AWS_HOST - The Host for your endpoint which can be found in Amazon's cloud interface
